# Children-Height-CIFAR10-classfication
Machine Learning Exercise Creating a Linear Classify with Gradient Descent from Scratch. This was an excersise in my machine learning class to create a Linear Classifier from scratch writing functions for gradient descent , calculating loss, and training the weights. Used Numpy matrix math to minimize any looping within the program. Jupyter Notebooks are Attached.
## Kid Height Data
Attached CSV with Child Height Data with two features as predictors. 
## CIFAR10 Data
Attached Train and Test Batches of CIFAR 10 Dataset. Learned 10-2 Class Classifiers to Predict the data. Although I realize this is not the most efficient or best way to do this, it was a good exercise to learn how to create a classifier, and program loss and gradient functions without using libaries.
